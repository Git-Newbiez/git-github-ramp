## Songfacts

1. The song’s lyrics were written solely by Freddie Mercury, Queen’s frontman. There has been much speculation about their meaning. Some words, like “Bismillah” (which means “In the name of Allah”) and “Beelzebub” (one of the many names for The Devil), appear in the Qu’ran. Mercury’s upbringing in Zanzibar and his family’s involvement in Zoroastrianism may have influenced these Arabic references. However, Mercury himself remained tight-lipped about the true meaning, stating that it’s a song with a fantasy feel that listeners should interpret for themselves

2. The song’s backing track came together quickly, but Queen spent days overdubbing the vocals. By the end, about 180 tracks were layered together, pushing the analog recording technology to its limits. Producer Roy Thomas Baker recalls Mercury enthusiastically adding more “Galileos” during the process
Galileo Connection: Mercury may have included the word “Galileo” in the lyrics as a nod to guitarist Brian May, who is an astronomy buff. Galileo Galilei, the famous astronomer, was the first to use a refracting telescope
